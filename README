This is a plugin to the Pentaho BIServer 3.x to support the ability of a plugin 
to provide a standard J2EE Servlet as a content generator.  This plugin also adds
a JAXRS compatibility layer that allows you to define JAXRS beans in spring xml
within your plugin.

To build, run:
$ ant
Note: this will run a resolve which will download the missing jars to make your project compile, and eclipse happy too

If you want to deploy to an existing Pentaho BIServer, run:
$ ant install
Note: this requires paths to your BIServer install to be correct in build.properties
